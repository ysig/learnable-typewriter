# The Learnable Typewriter <br><sub>A Generative Approach to Text Analysis</sub>
Official PyTorch implementation of [The Learnable Typewriter: A Generative Approach to Text Αnalysis](https://imagine.enpc.fr/~siglidii/learnable-typewriter/).  
Authors: [Yannis Siglidis](https://imagine.enpc.fr/~siglidii/), [Nicolas Gonthier](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/gonthier/), [Julien Gaubil](https://juliengaubil.github.io/), [Tom Monnier](https://www.tmonnier.com/), [Mathieu Aubry](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~aubrym/).  
Research Institute: [Imagine](https://imagine.enpc.fr/), _LIGM, Ecole des Ponts, Univ Gustave Eiffel, CNRS, Marne-la-Vallée, France_  
To appear in [ICDAR 2024](https://icdar2024.net/).

## Install :seedling:
```shell
conda create --name ltw pytorch==1.9.1 torchvision==0.10.1 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch -c conda-forge
conda activate ltw
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Datasets :sunny: Models :hammer:
**Dropbox**: Download & extract [datasets.zip](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0fa9hcbfu9vr3t2/datasets.zip?dl=0) and [runs.zip](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c4c7lbp1ydqs9dj/runs.zip?dl=0) in the parent folder.
**Huggingface**: `python scripts/download-hf.py'


## Inference :peach:
For minimal inference and plotting we provide a [standalone notebook. ![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yDL_HGncDiMzShA7c-OZYOgYrb1_qqGf)

To reproduce the figures of the paper run the `scripts/figures.ipynb` notebook.

Helper scripts are also provided to perform evaluation on the corresponding datasets:

```python
python scripts/eval.py -i <MODEL-PATH> {--eval, --eval_best}
```

and produce figures and sprites for certain samples:

```python
python scripts/eval.py -i <MODEL-PATH> -s {train, val, test} -id 0 0 0 -is 1 2 3 --plot_sprites
```

## Training :blossom:
Training and model configure is performed though hydra.
We supply the corresponding config files for all our baseline experiments.

### Google :newspaper:
```python
python scripts/train.py supervised-google.yaml
python scripts/train.py unsupervised-google.yaml
```

### Copiale :scroll:
```python 
python scripts/train.py supervised-copiale.yaml
python scripts/train.py unsupervised-copiale.yaml
```

### Fontenay :church:
```python
python scripts/train.py supervised-fontenay.yaml
```

and finetune with:

```python
python scripts/fontenay.py -i fontenay/fontenay/<MODEL_NAME> -o fontenay/fontenay-ft/ --max_epochs 150 -k "training.optimizer.lr=0.001"
```

> To all of the above experiment config files, additional command line overrides could be applied to further modify them using the [hydra syntax](https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/override_grammar/basic/).

### Custom Dataset :floppy_disk:
Trying the LT on a new dataset is dead easy.

First create a config file:

```
configs/<DATASET_ID>.yaml

...

DATASET-TAG:
  path: <DATASET-NAME>/
  sep: ''                    # How the character separator is denoted in the annotation. 
  space: ' '                 # How the space is denoted in the annotation.
```

Then create the dataset folder:

```
datasets/<DATASET-NAME>
├── annotation.json
└── images
  ├── <image_id>.jpg
  └── ...
```

The annotation.json file should be a dictionary with entries of the form:
```
    "<image_id>": {
        "split": "train",                            # {"train", "val", "test"} - "val" is ignored in the unsupervised case.
        "label": "A beautiful calico cat."           # The text that corresponds to this line.
    },
```

You can completely ignore the annotation.json file in the case of unsupervised training without evaluation.


### Logging :chart_with_downwards_trend:
Logging is done through tensorboard. To visualize results run:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir ./<run_dir>/
```
